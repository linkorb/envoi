### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
We take the security of our software and systems very seriously, and we appreciate your help in identifying and disclosing any vulnerabilities that you may find.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible by emailing us at security@linkorb.com. Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and address it. Please provide us with as much detail as possible, including:

* A detailed description of the vulnerability.
* Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
* Any relevant screenshots, logs, or other supporting information.
* We will review your report as quickly as possible and will work to validate and address the issue.
* Your name and contact information (if you wish to be credited for the discovery)

### Our Security Practices
* Regularly updating dependencies and libraries to address known security vulnerabilities
* Conducting regular security audits and code reviews
* Implementing secure coding practices and using secure development tools
* Keeping sensitive data (such as API keys or credentials) encrypted and protected
* Providing timely security updates and patches to address known vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure
We believe in responsible disclosure, and we ask that you do not disclose any details of a vulnerability that you have discovered until we have had a reasonable amount of time to address it. We will notify users of known vulnerabilities and the steps they should take to address them promptly. We will also publish a public advisory on our website and other relevant channels once a vulnerability has been confirmed and addressed.
